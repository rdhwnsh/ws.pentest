        <h3>HTTP vs HTTPS</h3>
        <p>Most webpages have adopted HTTPS as it encrypts data that is going through, however there is some webpages
            that still do not adopt HTTPS and still is using HTTP, HTTP is very dangerous as anything that is send
            through POST/GET will be listed for hackers to take the data and (maybe) decrypt.</p>

        <h3>So if im using HTTPS im safe?</h3>
        <p>No! There is a thing called the Man In The Middle attack (MITM) where connections go through the MITM
            meaning that even though the victim goes through HTTP, the MITM will still be able to capture the data.</p>

        <h3>AM I HACKED?!?!?!?!?!</h3>
        <p>Nope, this website doesnt collect any data and it is a static page. You can check if its true by going to
            the Developer Tools in your browser and checking the sources. In fact, this webpage has no Javascript.</p>
